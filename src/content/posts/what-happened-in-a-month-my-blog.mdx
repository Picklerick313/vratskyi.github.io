## Where have I been?

to update the site, so that's what I've been doing.)

## Well, and I didn't forget to update my site

<span class="space-y-xl"></span>

**Updated:**
<span class="space-y"></span> 

    - Updated user interface
	- Updated style file
	- Fixed a bug where <code>@tailwindcss/typography </code> was not being applied to the blog
	- Added automatic sorting of posts by date, from new to old
	- Removed unnecessary code from input.css
    - Added astro-compress package to compress files during project build, default settings: <code> CSS: true, HTML: false, Image: true, JavaScript: true, SVG: false </code>

<span class="space-y-xl"></span>

**What I plan to do in future updates:**
<span class="space-y"></span> 

 - Add pagination to the blog page
 - Integrate i18n, translate the site into another language
 - Add sitemap.xml generation
 - Maybe add some hedless cms
